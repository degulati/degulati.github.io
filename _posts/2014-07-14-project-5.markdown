description: In this project, I leveraged ROS packages for using the complete navigation stack for localization, mapping, planning, and control. I worked with Linux, Docker, ROS, LiDAR, IMU, RGBD Camera, and NVIDIA's Jetson Xavier and programmed in Python to enable a 1/10-scale RC car to drive autonomously. I'm representing Triton AI, a UCSD student-run team at the DIY Robocars race this August in Oakland, CA!
