description: For my senior design project, my team and I worked with ATA Engineering, a San Diego-based engineering consulting firm. This project focused on the continued development of a robotic figure to improve in-house analysis and control capabilities. The project’s motivation is to implement new functionality on an existing robotic figure by improving the design, analysis methods, and control system of the current figure to demonstrate to ATA customers. The figure consists of an actuated arm and torso that can be controlled using an Arduino system. Major requirements of the project include redesigning of the torso to reduce the instability, mainly from tilting moment present in the current torso turntable; developing and implementing a breakaway mechanism at the upper arm segment of the animatronic figure; and implementing a control system that predicts arm breakage under different motion profiles, modifies the motion profile parameters to prevent arm breakage without changing the overall visual effect, and uses a control strategy to safely operate the robot arm if a breakaway occurs. In the final design, the torso was redesigned with a slewing bearing table which reduced the tilting moment by 7.9°. The final design prototype has multiple link-force settings controlled by an Arduino-driven electromagnet and analytical control of the motion profile. To predict breakaway events on the actual figure for a certain force setting and profile, a dynamic model was created to simulate when a breakaway event occurs under different motion profiles and correlated with results from testing the actual figure. Using different trapezoidal motion profiles, the magnet pull force setting was increased to avoid a breakaway for a profile that caused a breakaway at a lower force setting, which successfully satisfied acceptance testing requirements from ATA. Additionally, our physical model in simulation of the robotic figure is able to predict whether or not a breakaway occurs for different motion profiles accurately.
