description: In the fall of 2020, I interned at Tata Elxsi, an engineering services company in Bengalaru, India as a software engineer on the Video Analytics team. During COVID-19, many schools and universities were facing challenges in adapting to remote learning, with one problem being administering online exams. To address this, Tata Elxsi worked on developing a proctoring tool available on their video analytics platform, AIVA. I assisted in developing a front-end user interface that (1) displays analytics in an accessible manner and (2) sends and receives data from the back-end. The back-end provides head pose estimation, facial detection, and gaze tracking. The interface allows a user to test out the software by taking a screen-recording of the user's laptop with permission; grabbing the frames from the resulting screen recording; sending them to the back-end, where the facial detection models analyze the frames and output the resulting frames; receiving the analyzed frames from the back-end and displaying them in real-time.
