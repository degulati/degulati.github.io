description: Towards the end of 2020, I interned at the Mobility & AI Lab at Nissan Motors in Atsugi, Japan as a data scientist intern on the human factors group. I worked on analyzing a 3TB dataset consisting of pedestrian and vehicle trajectories at a road intersection. I performed data cleaning, programmed algorithms to compute parameters, and developed visualizations using seaborn in a jupyter notebook. I presented these results to different research teams and senior management at a quarterly meeting in Japanese. This work was for the ultimate goal of creating an AI model that uses the computed parameters to predict whether a driver will go or not go at an intersection.
