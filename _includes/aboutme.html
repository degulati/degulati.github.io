                    <p class="about-me-description">I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego and am looking for opportunities! At UCSD, I've taken coursework in both Mechanical engineering and Computer science and have developed a love for programming and building software.
                        I have experience in Python, Java, Javascript, C++, ROS, and Linux through projects and internships. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and traveling. I look forward to learning new technical skills
                        and adding value to an employer willing to provide me with an opportunity.
